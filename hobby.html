<h1>Iowa State</h1>
<ul>
<li>
I picked Iowa State as a favorite team as a child because of their colors.
</li>
<li>
Also, I was sick of Iowa fans always complaining about their team instead of supporting them.
</li>
<li>
This put me in the minority, since I lived in Iowa City.
</li>
<li>
Luckily, recent success with the basketball team have made the years of struggle worth it.
